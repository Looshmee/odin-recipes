# odin-recipes

This is my first project in The Odin Project. I have created a basic recipe website. It consists of a main index page and has links to three recipes. This project is built entirely with HTML so it is not the prettiest. The main things I have practiced in this project are using the HTML boilerplate, headings, lists, links, images, and using git.
